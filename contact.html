          <p>I currently am working for Grand Rapids Community College
          I am a Proffessional tutor that assist students in the better understanding 
          of chemistry, physics and calculous.  I also help to improve the resources that are in the 
          facility.  This involves lots of attentive problem solving, both in figuring out how to help students
          and figuring out how to solve physical science questions.  (Lets just say, I'm good with units)
          I have worked there since August of 2019</p>

          <br>
          <p>I had previously worked for Grand Valley State University as an adjunct professor in 
            freshmen and sophmore laboratories.  Here I instructed students on proper laboratory safety and
            laboratory technique.  Teaching is one of my favorite things to do.  
            I worked here from 2018-2020, up until the beginning of the pandemic.

        <h2><u>Previous Employment continued</u>
          <br>
          <p>In a past life I was a bartender.  I worked for ten+ years in the service industry.
            My first job was at Founders Brewing Co.  I started as a bar-back and worked my way up
            throught the rands to be a manager in that postion.  It is where I found my nack for directing
            people effectively and efficiently.  I worked at Founders from 2010-2016.

        <h2><u>Previous Employment continued</u>
          <br>
          <p> I went on to work at another local brewery, Grey Line Brewing Co. in Grand Rapids, MI., for a short stint.
            I then tried my hand in the art of making cocktails at a local distillery.  I worked
            at Eastern Kille Distilliery in Grand Rapids, MI. from 2017-2019.  There I learned how to formally make a cocktail,
            as well as informally make liquours, aperitifs, digestifs, bitters and much more.  In this time
            I also consulted a bit in the distillation process, putting my formal
            education of chemistry to good use.

        <h2><u>Previous Employment continued</u>
          <br>
          <p>  Around the same time I was working at Eastern Kille, I started working at The Sovengard in Grand Rapids MI.
          This was from 2018-2020.  Here I put all my knowledge of beer and spirits to the test as a resident bartender.
          This Job abruptly ended in the advent of the novel carona virus we are all so familiar with.
