            <p class="text">My name is Anthony Richard Spyker, shortened to Anthony R. Spyker.  I currently reside in Grand Rapids, Michigan.   I was born in Muskegon, Michigan on October 7th, 1985 at 10:05 AM.  I grew up just south in Grand Haven, Michigan with my mother, father and sister.  
              After graduating High School in 2004 I went on to gain an associate degree in liberal arts from Muskegon Community College followed by a stint at  Grand Valley State university for a year working toward a bachelor’s in political science and philosophy.  During the course of my early 20’s I traveled around the pacific north west and central continental united states attending concerts and enjoying a simple laissez-faire lifestyle before I returned to west Michigan and began a 6-year stint at Founders brewing co.  There I did everything front of house, from bussing and food running all the way up to bartending and managing. During that 6 years at Founders brewing co. I attended Grand Rapids Community College where I received a Lab technician associates.  Directly following spent 2 more years at Grand Valley State University where I completed a bachelor’s in science and Mathematics with an emphasis on Chemistry and pure mathematics.  I performed research under the tutelage of Dr. John Bender and presented some work in front of esteemed Chemistry community at the 2017 American Chemical Society conference in San Francisco.  After college I continued working as a professional tutor at Grand Rapids Community College and an adjunct professor for chemistry at Grand Valley State University.  All the while working random bartending jobs at Eastern Kille Distillery and The Sovengaurd, both located in Grand Rapids, MI. Eastern Kille Distillery offered me an opportunity to use some of my chemistry knowledge by consulting in their distillation program. As of April 2021, I have completed a Coding bootcamp certification through Michigan State University and will be amply ready to begin coding in a professional arena.  
              I hope the reader recognizes my ample ability for self starting and redefining myself.  I have worked hard to not be pigeon held or put in one specific box.  I like to have my hands in many pots as it were and experience as much as I can. With the skill sets of physical science as well as full stack web development, I believe I am set to make strides in the professional problem-solving arena moving forward.
