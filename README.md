# Portfolio
This site is a fully interactive portfolio web site.  It is broken up into three pages.  All pages share the navigation bar which includes; a links to a portfolio page, a link to a skills and experience page and my name, Anthony R. Spyker, which act as a link back to the bio page.  There is also a link to my email address, where a user can contact me directly and there is also a link to my resume, that the user can download and print off if they are interested.  Finally in the navigation bar there are links to my linked in and my git hub profile pages.  This page is supported by, Javascript functionality and css stylings.  Bootstrap and font awesome were also imported for some styling purposes.
